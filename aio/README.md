[learning about python asyncio](https://realpython.com/async-io-python/)

- A function that you introduce with async def is a coroutine. It may use await, return, or yield, but all of these are optional. Declaring async def noop(): pass is valid:
  - Using await and/or return creates a coroutine function. To call a coroutine function, you must await it to get its results.
  - It is less common (and only recently legal in Python) to use yield in an async def block. This creates an asynchronous generator, which you iterate over with async for. Forget about async generators for the time being and focus on getting down the syntax for coroutine functions, which use await and/or return.
  - Anything defined with async def may not use yield from, which will raise a SyntaxError.
- Just like itâ€™s a SyntaxError to use yield outside of a def function, it is a SyntaxError to use await outside of an async def coroutine. You can only use await in the body of coroutines.


```py
async def f(x):
    y = await z(x)  # OK - `await` and `return` allowed in coroutines
    return y

async def g(x):
    yield x  # OK - this is an async generator

async def m(x):
    yield from gen(x)  # No - SyntaxError

def m(x):
    y = await z(x)  # Still no - SyntaxError (no `async def` here)
    return y
```
